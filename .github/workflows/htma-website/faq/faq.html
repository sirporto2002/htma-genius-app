    <h2>What is HTMA?</h2>
    <p>Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA) is a lab test that measures the levels and ratios of minerals in your hair tissue. It helps assess metabolic function, toxicity, and more.</p>

    <h2>Why use hair instead of blood?</h2>
    <p>Hair provides a longer-term view of mineral status and toxic accumulation, whereas blood shows momentary levels.</p>

    <h2>Is HTMA safe and non-invasive?</h2>
    <p>Yes! It's a completely non-invasive test. Just cut a small hair sample from the scalp — no needles, no blood.</p>

    <h2>How long does it take to get results?</h2>
    <p>After your sample is submitted, results are typically ready in 7–10 business days.</p>
